It also makes it easy to show any unfinished work to customers. \r\n\r\n##Main branches\r\n\r\n###Develop\r\n- Branch for showing new features  to customer etc.\r\n- deployed to dev server\r\n- Feature / hotfix branches can be merged here anytime for testing purposes\r\n- This branch can be reset to master anytime, so no code living only in this branch will end up in production\r\n\r\n###Master\r\n- Integration / QA for next release\r\n- Deployed to stage server\r\n- Base branch for all new features\r\n\r\n###Production\r\n- Production\r\n- Always equal to the actual code currently running on production servers\r\n\r\n\r\n##Development workflow\r\n\r\n###New feature\r\n- create new branch from master \r\n  - feature/#[issue/ticket id]-issueTitle (where # is C for extra/cont dev cases and I for incidents)\r\n- merge to develop for testing / acceptance\r\n- merge to master once finished /accepted (or create merge / review request)\r\n\r\n###Epic features\r\nSometimes there might be bigger project that needs to be developed separately and where different features are dependant from each other\r\n- create new epic branch from master epic/[EpicName]\r\n- create all the feature branches that belong to this project from the epic branch feature/[EpicName]/[featureInThisEpic]\r\n- merge feature branches to epic branch, then epic branch to develop for testing\r\n- if needed epic branch can be reset to master to clean up experimental features\r\n- only delete feature branches after the epic branch is accepted to master\r\n- for release treat epic branch as any other feature branch \r\n\r\n###Hotfix\r\n- create new branch from production\r\n- hotfix/#[ticket id]-issueTitle (where # is C for extra/cont dev cases and I for issues, so usually I)\r\n- merge to develop for testing\r\n- merge to production for release (or create merge / review request)\r\n- rebase master to production\r\n\r\n\r\n###Release\r\n- Merge all accepted / finished feature branches to master (that are not yet merged)\r\n- Cleanup finished feature branches\r\n- Run tests on master\r\n- tag new release\r\n- Merge to production\r\n\r\n##examples\r\n\r\ncreate a new feature and push it to develop for testing\r\n```\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit pull origin master\r\ngit checkout -b feature/c1234-adding_this\r\ngit add\r\ngit commit [... reiterate as many time as needed]\r\ngit push origin feature/c1234-adding_this\r\ngit checkout develop\r\ngit pull origin develop\r\ngit merge --no-ff feature/c1234-adding_this\r\ngit push origin develop\r\n```\r\npublish a feature to master for the pre-release\r\n```\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit pull origin master\r\ngit merge --no-ff feature/c1234-adding_this\r\ngit push origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\npush master to production\r\n```\r\ngit checkout production\r\ngit pull origin production\r\ngit merge --no-ff master\r\ngit tag -a mytag -m “mytag”\r\ngit push origin production\r\ngit push --tags\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wunderkraut/wunderflow/master/img/WunderFlow1.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wunderkraut/wunderflow/master/img/WunderFlow_epic1.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
